Greetings, 

    Thankyou for assigning me this project. I am pleased to say that I have implemented all 
    tasks, required and bonus. 

TechStack Used:
    - Python
    - Docker
    - Plotly
    - Flask
    - Postgres Database
    - Pandas
    - AJAX
    
Approach - 
    I first setup docker on my machine (MacOS), further i pulled postgres image and implemented
    certain commands just to understand the schema. Then I logged into localhost to view the 
    schema definition. Once docker setup was completed, I moved on to Flask implementation.
    In app.py you may find some routes that allow users to - 
        1. View database tables.
        2. Plot Graphs as per entries.
        3. Download .csv files of respective tables.
        4. Reset Entries.
    
    View Database tables - this allows you to view certain entries from the tables and see the 
    trends over time on those entries only.
    
    Plot Graphs - Users would find 2 entry fields that allows them to add the start and end dates 
    then the graphs are plotted as per those dates.

    Download .csv files - You can see 3 blue buttons on the top of the web page that allow users
    download the .csv files of respective tables.

    Reset Entries - Since i could not update the database with any newer values, I decided to 
    refresh the data to the initial 5 values of each row without any plots. For this i used AJAX
    thus users do not have to reload the entire page but instead you can click on that button to 
    reset all entries. Further user can select any 2 values and plot a graph.

    Note - For entering start and end time, just copy paste the timestamp entry and click submit.

Commands - 
    docker compose up -d
    export FLASK_APP=app.py
    flask run
The app would start at port 5000.

Thankyou for you time!
